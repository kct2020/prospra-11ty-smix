# Keith's Heading

Project notes here with original README below. Then I'll rewrite this if it works. Initially, I want to: 
- deploy to Cloudflare Pages. 
Then later:
- add PWA capabilities, including push notifications (OneSignal).
Amend this todo list as project progresses. Adding detailed notes below with latest changes first

## 210818b 1st Config
Usually, I create a 1st Config branch to get a working site with config changes as per original README instructions and note files changed with any additional notes. Most of this detail is deleted from final README but it serves to keep track of installation progress. I can't find any configuraton notes in the Smix code. But here's what I've found to change so far:
- /src/data/site.json - author info
- /src/layouts/default.liquid - not been personalized so not sure this is right place

So I'll deploy to Cloudflare now, and investigate live site for required changes.

## 210818a Preparation
Notes for my workflow instructions:
- Created new repo (not fork because that seems to imply a commitment to update original which is not my intention for my own starter. Not sure what best practise is)
- Imported https://github.com/hirusi/smix-eleventy-starter
- Renamed LICENSE to LICENSE-smix and used `Add file` to add a BSD-3 LICENSE (see commit notes for reasoning). Note: Github helpfully offers templates when the new filename is LICENSE.
